For the purposes of this project we utilized the Comma2K19 dataset, (and can be
downloaded from https://github.com/commaai/comma2k19) that was provided to us within the details of the project documentation. However in order to decrease the overall computation time that would have been incurred if we utilized the entire dataset at every phase of the project, hence we opted to randomly pick a chunk of data from the overall dataset and conducted the various phases of the project upon that chunk and in order to further reaffirm the obtained results, we utilized a video that we made ourselves and passed it through each phase of the project as well.
